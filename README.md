# ContactBookAndroidApp
A simple contact book Android application made using kotlin and SQLlite Databases

I developed an Android contact book app using a standard SQLite database to manage contact details. The app supports CRUD operations, allowing me to add, view, update, and delete contacts. By implementing SQLite directly, I handled data storage efficiently, making it easy to manage contact information within the app.
